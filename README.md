# ML_dimensionalityReduction
This repository contains two dimensionality reduction models-PCA and LDA.
Dimensionality reduction is important to reduce the complexity and dimensionality of the data for faster and more efficient processing.
Here we are using Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithms for the same.
